Hello! My name is Norbert Kovács.

I am currently working as a Junior Application Developer at ZF-ITCH. My job includes designing complete systems for OEM Keymanagement projects and participating in the development, including backend and frontend development as well.
Working at ZF is truly fulfilling, thanks to the incredible team that surrounds me.

Other than programming, I have a lot of hobbies. Mainly graphic design related and woodworking. But I really enjoy any creative work. From Videoediting to making animation, or building something with my own hands.
